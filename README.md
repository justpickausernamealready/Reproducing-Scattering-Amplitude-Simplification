# Reproducing-Scattering-Amplitude-Simplification
We attempt to reproduce the results from ['Learning the Simplicity of Scattering Amplitudes' by C. Cheunga, A. Dersyb, and M. D. Schwartz](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04720) where long expressions for scattering amplitudes are shortened, changing the method slightly by using deep neural networks instead of transformers.
